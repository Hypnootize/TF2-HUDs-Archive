<h2>CONTRIBUTING</h2>

Anyone is free to contribute to this repository through pull requestes! You can submit new HUDs, missing links and errors reviews by forking this repository, editing the files and creating a new pull request. For new HUDs submission the download, album and HUD/Creator names **must** be included.

*Note: HUDs made through any online HUD editor are not accepted. In order to limit the amount of HUD edits in the list I also might not accept simple/quick HUD edits, or edits that only feature customizations already present it the original HUD*
